You are a senior front-end/UI engineer and product designer tasked with **redesigning the existing Luxury Stays Club website** to look and feel like a top-tier, best-in-class luxury brand in the short-term rental and property management space.

Your #1 rule:
- **Do NOT break any existing functionality.**
- Preserve all current behavior, routes, forms, and interactions.
- If JS hooks/IDs/classes look “functional” (used by scripts), keep them or refactor carefully without changing behavior.

- High-end luxury properties (Park City, Deer Valley, Heber City, etc.)
- Full-service management for owners

- 24/7 concierge and white-glove service

Key differentiators (these should be visually and structurally highlighted in the design):
- Luxury Experience
- Local Expertise
- 24/7 Concierge
- Comprehensive Property Management
- Owner Benefits (revenue optimization, reporting, care)
- “Family-owned” & “premium but warm” feel

Recommended structure:
1. Hero Section
   - Strong headline emphasizing luxury property management in Utah.
   - Subheadline summarizing value to property owners.
   - Primary CTA (e.g., “Schedule a Consultation”, “Get a Management Proposal”).
   - Secondary CTA (e.g., “View Our Services”).
   - Background: high-end property imagery + subtle overlay + custom SVG accents.

2. Trust & Positioning Strip
   - Short row highlighting: “Family-Owned”, “Utah Luxury Specialists”, “24/7 Concierge”, etc.
   - Use icons + short labels.

3. Services Overview
   - “Comprehensive Property Management” broken into:
     - Property Care
     - Guest Services
     - Owner Benefits
   - Each in its own card/section with icons, short bullet lists, and clear headings.

4. “About Luxury Stays Club” / Our Story

--------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM SVG ASSETS & IMAGERY
--------------------------------------------------
Build a cohesive set of **custom SVG assets** that support the brand:

Types of SVGs:
- Hero decorative shapes: subtle line art of mountains, rooftops, or Utah-inspired contours.
- Service icons:
  - Property Care (house/maintenance icon)
  - Guest Services (bell/concierge icon)
  - Owner Benefits (chart/graph icon)
  - 24/7 Concierge (clock/phone icon)
- “Luxury” details:
  - Minimalist line art of keys, door hangers, skyline silhouettes, hot tubs, etc.
- Section dividers:
  - Soft curves or subtle line patterns for transitions between sections.

Requirements:
- SVGs must be:
  - Responsive (proper viewBox)
  - Lightweight and optimized
  - Using `currentColor` where possible
- Use them as inline SVGs or components per the existing stack.
- Imagery:
  - Use/assume **high-quality photography** of:
    - Luxury interiors
    - Mountain/lake views from Utah
    - Cozy but upscale details (fireplaces, hot tubs, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------
ANIMATIONS & MICROINTERACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------
Introduce **subtle, elegant animations** that enhance the luxury feel without being flashy:

- Page load:
  - Soft fade-in of hero copy and CTAs.
- Scroll-based:
  - Section titles and cards gently fade/slide into view.
- Hover states:
  - Cards slightly lift + shadow/elevation.
  - Buttons with smooth color/outline transitions.
- SVGs:
  - Minimal motion details (e.g., shimmer on dividers, soft parallax on hero art).
- Performance:
  - Favor CSS transforms / opacity.
  - Keep animations light for mobile devices.

Avoid:
- Overly bouncy or cartoonish animations.
- Anything that cheapens the luxury feel.

--------------------------------------------------
CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION
--------------------------------------------------
The page must be **highly converting**, especially for property owners.

Add/optimize:
- Clear primary CTA repeated across page.
- Short “What you get as an owner” summary near top.
- Simple “How it works” or “Our process” 3-step section:
  1. Schedule a call
  2. We evaluate and onboard your property
  3. You earn more, we handle everything
- Trust elements:
  - “Family-owned in Utah”
  - “Specialized in Park City, Deer Valley, Heber City”
  - Optional: placeholder for reviews / testimonials / logos.

Forms:
- Keep the contact form **fully functional** (don’t break existing behavior).
- Improve design & UX:
  - Larger, well-labeled inputs.
  - Clear validation states and error messages.
  - Luxurious styling (borders, focus states, subtle shadows).
- Make it extremely easy to reach out:
  - Clearly show email, maybe add “Copy email” or “Click to email” if appropriate.
  - Consider a short inline inquiry form near hero or CTA block if not already present.
